# HomePhysio

â€˜Home Physio' is a website where patients can book appointments for home physiotherapy sessions who are unable to visit a clinic or hospital for an extended period of time or on a regular basis. This website also aims to provide a freelancing platform for physiotherapists. The patients and physiotherapists gain access to the website through a registration form and an email confirmation after which, distinct dashboards for the users are provided for accessing the system features. The therapist can provide and update their available time slot, respond to the appointment request made by patient and view their appointment schedule and the patients can choose from a range of physiotherapists based on gender, location and specialization. The payable amount will be computed by adding the consultation fee and the distance-based travel fee.

Developed as Minor Project By 3rd year students at National college of Engineering.
